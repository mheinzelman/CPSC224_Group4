This program uses three classes to simmulate a Yahtzee game. It uses inheritance to build off the different classes to simulate the game. The biggest issue I had was the translating, I would not see an error since I was reading it as C++, after some patience it worked out fine. After thinking it out and having more patience with it it worked out. If I had more time I would make it more unique, extend it as a game and make it less likely to crash, with either more exceptions and user input checkers.
