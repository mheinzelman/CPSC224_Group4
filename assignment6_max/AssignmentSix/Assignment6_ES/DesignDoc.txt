Design Documentation

The goal of this assignment was to implement a game
of Yahtzee and to improve assignment 5 by allowing the 
The user to decide how many dice to use, how many sides
The dice have, and how many rolls per turn. It was also 
Improved by asking the user what line from the scorecard
They would like to take each turn and saving it.

The design of this program was the same as assignment
5 but I added a new class called ScoreArray that holds the 
Score that you save from each turn, and also holds a 
Boolean variable to tell if that specific line has been used.

The only issues I had with this assignment were figuring
Out how to dave the scores from each turn, this was solved
With the ScoreArray class.

If I had more time with this assignment I would
make sure that the program could handle any error
that was thrown at it. I would also try to improve my
classes to be more general so that certain aspects
of the game could be easily changed.
